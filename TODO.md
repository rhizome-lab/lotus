# Viwo TODOs

## Long-term Vision

- **AI**: AI support for the Monaco editor using the above types, using live feedback from LSP. This should use the AI plugin.
- **Frontends**: Flesh out all frontends
  - TUI (should have the same layout as web frontend)
  - Discord bot
- **TUI**: Script editor support for TUI.
- **Security**: Capability based security
  - Does this/should this replace the current permissions system?
- **System Integration**: System integration as (optional) libraries
  - IO, FS, network etc. (these MUST use capability based security)
